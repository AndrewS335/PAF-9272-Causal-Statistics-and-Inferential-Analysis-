Instructions: Submit your main file (the one with answers and graphs etc.) as PDF! Submit separate do and log files for each part! Provide answers in full sentences and include units/% when appropriate!  
Part 1. (Penn World Table Data) In this problem you are working with macroeconomic data for a set of larger countries (population size > 1 million). 
1. Read in the data set PWT_HW1.dta and open a log (smcl) file.
2. Use “describe” and the “Data Editor (Browse)” to familiarize yourself with the data structure and variables.
3. What is the unit of observation in these data? What is the sample size for the data pertaining to the country “USA”? Pick another country of your choosing and report its sample size.
4. The variable “rgdp_pc” is Real Gross Domestic Product Per Capita, which is a common measure of (average) living standard in a country. To facilitate comparability across countries the units of living standard are US dollars for all countries, so a value of 40,000 in a country in 2019 represents a living standard of US$ 40,000. 
4a. Generate a scatterplot of living standard (Y=rgdp_pc) over time (X=year) in the US using “twoway (scatter rgdp_pc year if countrycode=="USA")”. Include the plot in your answer. Based on the plot, answer the following:
i)	What is the (approximate) overall form of this relationship (e.g., linear, non-linear, clustered, no relationship/white noise)? 
ii)	If you identified an approximately linear or non-linear overall form, comment on what the direction of this relationship is (e.g., positive, negative)? (Otherwise state that “A direction cannot be determined since the form is neither linear nor non-linear”.)
iii)	If you identified an approximate overall form (either linear, non-linear or clustered) then comment on the overall strength of the relationship, i.e. how closely the scattered data points follow the overall form that you identified (this can range from “strength is very high” to “strength is very weak”). (If you were not able to identify an approximate overall form then state that “The strength of the relationship cannot be determined here since there is no relationship apparent”.)
iv)	Report the relationship’s correlation coefficient, r, using the pwcorr command. Carefully interpret what the sign of your r and its value relative to 0 mean (one sentence for each)!
v)	Argue based on the overall form you identified in i) whether or not the use of r is appropriate (Hint: use of r is only appropriate if the overall form is approximately linear).
4b. Using all countries, generate a scatterplot of human capital (X=hc) – a measure of how skilled the workforce is in a country – and living standard (Y=rgdp_pc) in 2019 using “twoway (scatter rgdp_pc hc if year==2019)”. Include the plot in your answer. Based on the plot, answer the following:
i)	What is the (approximate) overall form of this relationship (e.g., linear, non-linear, clustered, no relationship/white noise)? 
ii)	If you identified an approximately linear or non-linear overall form, comment on what the direction of this relationship is (e.g., positive, negative)? (Otherwise state that “A direction cannot be determined since the form is neither linear nor non-linear”.)
iii)	If you identified an approximate overall form (either linear, non-linear or clustered) then comment on the overall strength of the relationship, i.e. how closely the scattered data points follow the overall form that you identified (this can range from “strength is very high” to “strength is very weak”). (If you were not able to identify an approximate overall form then state that “The strength of the relationship cannot be determined here since there is no relationship apparent”.)
iv)	Report the relationship’s correlation coefficient, r, using the pwcorr command. Carefully interpret what the sign of your r and its value relative to 0 mean (one sentence for each)!
v)	Argue based on the overall form you identified in i) whether or not the use of r is appropriate (Hint: use of r is only appropriate if the overall form is approximately linear).
4c. Using all countries, generate a scatterplot of the size of the export economy in a country (X=csh_x) and its living standard (Y=rgdp_pc) in 2019 using “twoway (scatter rgdp_pc csh_x if year==2019)”. Include the plot in your answer. Based on the plot, answer the following:
i)	What is the (approximate) overall form of this relationship (e.g., linear, non-linear, clustered, no relationship/white noise)? 
ii)	If you identified an approximately  linear or non-linear overall form, comment on what the direction of this relationship is (e.g., positive, negative)? (Otherwise state that “A direction cannot be determined since the form is neither linear nor non-linear”.)
iii)	If you identified an approximate overall form (either linear, non-linear or clustered) then comment on the overall strength of the relationship, i.e. how closely the scattered data points follow the overall form that you identified (this can range from “strength is very high” to “strength is very weak”). (If you were not able to identify an approximate overall form then state that “The strength of the relationship cannot be determined here since there is no relationship apparent”.)
iv)	Report the relationship’s correlation coefficient, r, using the pwcorr command. Carefully interpret what the sign of your r and its value relative to 0 mean (one sentence for each)!
v)	Argue based on the overall form you identified in i) whether or not the use of r is appropriate (Hint: use of r is only appropriate if the overall form is approximately linear).

4d. Using all countries, generate a scatterplot the economic share of the government in a country (X=csh_g) and its living standard (Y=rgdp_pc) in 2019 using “twoway (scatter rgdp_pc csh_g if year==2019)”. Include the plot in your answer. Based on the plot, answer the following:
i)	What is the (approximate) overall form of this relationship (e.g., linear, non-linear, clustered, no relationship/white noise)? 
ii)	If you identified an approximately linear or non-linear overall form, comment on what the direction of this relationship is (e.g., positive, negative)? (Otherwise state that “A direction cannot be determined since the form is neither linear nor non-linear”.)
iii)	If you identified an approximate overall form (either linear, non-linear or clustered) then comment on the overall strength of the relationship, i.e. how closely the scattered data points follow the overall form that you identified (this can range from “strength is very high” to “strength is very weak”). (If you were not able to identify an approximate overall form then state that “The strength of the relationship cannot be determined here since there is no relationship apparent”.)
iv)	Report the relationship’s correlation coefficient, r, using the pwcorr command. Carefully interpret what the sign of your r and its value relative to 0 mean (one sentence for each)!
v)	Argue based on the overall form you identified in i) whether or not the use of r is appropriate (Hint: use of r is only appropriate if the overall form is approximately linear).

Part 2. (2019 Eurobarometer) Continue with the country assigned under HW1. 
1. Read in the data and open a log (smcl) file.
2. Use “describe” and “sum” to familiarize yourself with the data structure and variables.
3a. What is the average age (X-bar) and its Sampling or Standard Error (SEX-bar)? Provide two distinct interpretations of what this SE means.
3b. What is the proportion that took steps to reduce their CO2 emissions (p-hat) and its Sampling or Standard Error (SEp-hat)? Provide two distinct interpretations of what this SE means.
3c. For males and females separately (Hint: you can use “… if female==…” to look at subsamples by sex), estimate the proportion having difficulties paying their bills in the year prior to the survey. Report the corresponding (two) SEs that measure their statistical imprecision. Does the degree of imprecision differ by sex? If the number do differ explain carefully why they differ the way they do (Hint: remember the two key determinants of SE are how large and how heterogeneous the population is).     
3d. Consider the SE of average age that you estimated in 3a. How large would the sample need to be (at least) to estimate average age in the population with half the imprecision (half the SE!) found in the current survey?   
3e. Consider the p-hat and SEp-hat estimated in 3b (plus the fact that the Eurobarometer surveys can be considered Simple Random Samples). Describe the (approx.) sampling distribution of p-hat! (Remember to comment on all three properties of the sampling distribution: its the overall shape, its center and the dispersion of that distribution!)
4a. Report the estimated lower and upper bound of the 95% Confidence Interval for the true (unknown) average age in your country’s population (). Interpret this Confidence Interval. 
4b. Report the estimated lower and upper bound of the 99% Confidence Interval for (overall) average age. Interpret this Confidence Interval. How and why is this CI different from the one estimate in 4a?
4c. Report the estimated lower and upper bound (in %) of the 90% Confidence Interval for the true (unknown) proportion (p) in your country that took steps to reduce their CO2 emissions. Interpret this Confidence Interval. 
4d. For males and females separately, report the estimated 95% CI of the proportion having difficulties paying their bills. Interpret the two CIs. Comment on whether or not the CIs overlap (if they do not overlap that presents strong evidence that men and women are statistically significantly different in terms of the likelihood of experiencing financial difficulties in your country).
