Course Description
Causal Analysis and Inference (PAF 9272) is the second course in the research methods sequence. Upon completion of Data Collection and Description (PAF 9270), students can choose between this course and Data Analysis for Public Service (PAF 9271). PAF 9272 is meant for those interested in becoming analysts, researchers, or making quantitative data analysis an important element in their careers. It teaches students how to critically evaluate existing causal analyses of both qualitative and quantitative data and how to conduct statistical analyses to answer causal questions for domestic and international policy and practice. Compared to PAF 9271, PAF 9272 places greater emphasis on observational and experimental data from representative surveys and requires students to write programs (coding) to carry out statistical analyses using advanced statistical software such as Stata or R. The course provides a hands-on introduction to understanding causal evidence, covering logic models and mechanisms, case-oriented vs. variable-oriented approaches, correlation vs. causation, observational vs. (quasi) experimental data, treatment effect, confounding and omitted variable bias, complex survey sampling, generalizability, standard error, confidence interval estimation, hypothesis testing, statistical and practical significance, power analysis, multiple regression, and difference-in-differences estimation. Course sections will use applications tailored towards students’ interests and concentrations (e.g., sections more populated with MIA students will have a greater international focus). (Students who took PAF 9170 and PAF9172 and are interested in a more advanced methods course may be eligible to take this course for credit. Consult with the professor and your degree advisor.)   

PAF 9272 Course Learning Goals (for a mapping to the MPA program learning goals see below)
Upon completion of the course, an engaged students will be able to: 
1. Develop and describe causal theories, in the form of causal diagrams, including mechanisms and alternative explanations of correlations, using qualitative and quantitative research and non-research sources. 
2. Demonstrate understanding of causal research concepts, including causation, counterfactual, causal process tracing, generalizability, self-selection, control variables, omitted variable bias, experiments, random assignment, and training and validation datasets. 
3. Analyze data with statistical software (such as Stata or R), interpret and write effectively about descriptive and inferential statistics, including hypothesis testing and power analysis. 
4. Critically evaluate existing causal analyses of both qualitative and quantitative data, to draw valid and useful conclusions, including assessing generalizability, practical significance, and the quality of the causal evidence. 
5. Program (code) with statistical software to accomplish data analysis tasks including: cleaning data, merging complex datasets, creating new and transforming variables, visualizing data, and preparing tables and charts for professional reports and presentations. 
6. Design and conduct research and analyses to estimate causal effects using experimental and observational data, with appropriate methods, such as multiple regression and difference-in-differences.

Course Materials
1. (RVR) Remler, Dahlia K. & Van Ryzin, Gregg G. 2021. Research in Practice: Strategies for Description and Causation. Third edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE. Required. I will assign chapters for regular reading. It is generally less technical reading than the lecture notes and especially helpful for students looking for additional examples, applications, and discussion. It is designed with the use of data and research methods in your careers in mind.
2. (AP) Angrist, Joshua D. & Pischke, Jörn-Steffen (2015). Mastering ‘Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. I plan to assign selected chapters from this more technical text (Intro, Chapters 1 & 2, and Chapter 5). 
3. (DBCR) Diez, David M., Barr, Christopher D., and Çetinkaya-Rundel, Mine (2020). OpenIntro Statistics (various editions available; latest: 4th Ed.). Recommended for independent reading on basic statistical concepts and formulas. Comprehensive introduction to statistics; e-book available free here.
You will learn all relevant concepts in class. My lecture is tailored towards the specific needs of the PAF9270/PAF9272 sequence and the MPA/MIA program; hence, all materials provided, including commentary during the lecture, are the essential materials for you to succeed. 
4. Statistical software installed on a laptop that you can bring to every class is required. All students receive a free installation of Stata 18 SE for their personal laptop/desktop. Log onto your CUNY Dropbox here and then download the version appropriate for your hardware (win/mac) from the v18 folder here. (E.g., for win users this entails downloading the SetupState18.exe file. This download can take time depending on your network speed.) To complete installation you will need to select the version when prompted (select “StataSE”) and the License and Activation Key info provided on the pdf found in the parent directory. Download the file and try to complete the installation at home (wifi on campus can be slow). If needed I will try to help you complete the installation during the first class (or outside class). Additional help is available from MSPIA-Tech’s Jonathan Alarcon at mspia.tech@baruch.cuny.edu. If you need computing equipment the College may be able to help via its equipment loan program. Let me know as soon as possible if you are in need.

Blackboard and Other (Online) Materials
Course information, lecture notes and assignments will be posted on Blackboard, so check it regularly (and update your email address if it is outdated). We will use Slack (regularly) as additional engagement and communication space online. Introduce yourself, participate in activities, and comment in our Research & Analysis Slack channel here (link TBA). If you have a specific question (e.g., about a part on an assignment or a concept) please ask it in the slack workspace where I created a channel just for Q&A; that way everyone can benefit from the knowledge. 

Course Slides: I will post PowerPoint slides the blackboard web site. I reserve the right to make changes to the slides (including those already posted) at any time. The lecture notes/slides are outlines of the core material but of course are not intended to be a complete record of the class. Supplementary materials will be made available on blackboard so check it frequently!

Stata: I will show you how to use Stata in class as part of the lecture activities. Please bring a laptop with Stata to class. You will also need to practice at home. In addition, you can bring your laptop to office hours/share screen on zoom. Make sure that you try things out in advance to avoid computer glitches. 

Grading
In-person Attendance and Participation (1% each week, weeks 2-14)	13%
Assignment 1-6 (10% each)							60%
Quizzes (two multiple choice quizzes on Blackboard, 1% each)		  2%	
Final Exam									25%

Your final letter grade is based on your weighted average score calculated as shown above.  Your final letter grade is based on your weighted average score calculated as shown above. Following Baruch’s guidelines for gfraduate students, the grading system for this course is as follows: A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 60-69 (not a passing grade for graduate students); F: 59 or lower, where digits ending in 0-2.9 receive a (-), and those ending in 7.1-9.9 receive a (+), except for the range 93-100 receive an A.   

Attendance and Particiaption: In-person physical attendance of each class is required to earn the 1% Attendance & Participation credit per week (weeks 2-14, 13% total). The course material is advanced and requires continuous engagement by following and participating in my in-class lecture and completing in-class group activities. 1% point of credit is given for each class fully attended, on time and reasonably alert (13 possible % points throughout the semester, weeks 2-14). Students who attend class in person, participate productively in class discussion/activities and ask/answer questions will get full points for attendance and participation. Students who miss a class (see below), arrive late or leave early, or who never/rarely participate (incl. failing to bring a laptop and use Stata during activities) will get lower attendance/participation grades. A respectful and friendly atmosphere is a necessary condition for a good learning experience. As a member of MSPIA, I count on you to help make that happen!

This section is 100% in-person (on campus). If this time slot conflicts with your work schedule, your other courses/studies, or any family responsibilities then you should not take this course! (I may teach an online version next semester, so inquire with me and your MSPIA mentor if that is the modality you need.) If you miss a class for reasons other than CUNY-related activities (e.g., representing MSPIA at ANOVA) or a health emergency you/an immediate family member (partner, child or parent) experience(s) (email of proof within 7 days required) you will lose 1% per class that you fail to attend.

Major Assignments: There will be 6 major homework assignments worth 10% each and a final exam worth 25%. For parts of assignments involving Stata calculations, perform the analysis using a “do” file, write up a description in Word, and submit a copy of your Stata “log” (scml) file (I will tell you what these files are). Also hand in charts, tables or other summary data that explain your results, as appropriate. Always interpret the results to say what they mean, even if the interpretation seems obvious or similar to an earlier question. Describe your findings succinctly but include relevant detail and clear reference to any supporting statistics, in tables or graphs, to get full credit. 

Quizzes: I plan to give two multiple choice quizzes on Blackboard worth 1% each.

Collaboration Policy: You are allowed to discuss assignments with a classmate. However, when preparing your answers you must ensure that they are unambiguously your own. Each person must also produce their own Stata do and log file output (I may ask you to show me how you generated it!).

Late Assignment Policy: The due date for each homework assignment will be printed on the assignment sheet itself and can differ from the tentative date shown on the syllabus (I do not anticipate extensions but if there are I will announce them in class/on Blackboard and/or in an email). Because I may review assignments in class, late assignments are not accepted for credit. Timely completion is essential as the material builds on itself throughout the course. Please be that responsible person that you are to your friends and co-workers. 

Policy Regarding Make-Up Exams:
I plan to make the final exam “take-home”. Students anticipating a conflict or experiencing hardship for an entire exam period need to notify me as soon as possible (and before the due date). If valid excuses such as documented illness are put forth, I will accommodate students with a make-up exam or appropriate other assignment to earn the credit.

Classroom Management Policies
This course is lecture heavy. The typical in-person class will be 3/4 lecture and 1/4 student practice (e.g., exercises that you complete on your laptop using Stata). Attendance is mandatory and regular participation in activities such as answering questions and completing in-class activities are expected. Based on past student feedback, class recordings can be a very useful way to deepen the understanding of the material. I plan to record the class sessions (basic video of the zoom screen) and make them available within 24 hours of class via a link on Blackboard to my (unlisted) youtube channel. Any recordings will be deleted six months after the end of the course. 

Students with Disabilities
It is college policy to provide accommodations and academic adjustments for students with disabilities. Any student with a disability who may need accommodations in this class is requested to speak directly to Student Disability Services as early in the semester as possible. All discussions will remain confidential.  

Please note, the need for accommodations and the process for arranging them may be altered by COVID-19 and the safety protocols in place at the time of this course. Students with disabilities who may need some accommodation in order to fully participate in this class should contact Student Disability Services as soon as possible at disability.services@baruch.cuny.edu.

For additional information, please visit: https://provost.baruch.cuny.edu/facultyhandbook/disabilities_provostsmemo/ 
Non-Discrimination 
All complaints under CUNY's Policy On Equal Opportunity And Non-Discrimination should be reported to Baruch's Office of Diversity, Compliance & Equity Initiatives at: Diversity@baruch.cuny.edu.

Academic Integrity
Baruch College policy states, “Academic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Cheating, forgery, plagiarism and collusion in dishonest acts undermine the college’s educational mission and the students’ personal and intellectual growth. Baruch students are expected to bear individual responsibility for their work, to learn the rules and definitions that underlie the practice of academic integrity, and to uphold its ideals. Ignorance of the rules is not an acceptable excuse for disobeying them. Any student who attempts to compromise or devalue the academic process will be sanctioned.” 

Additional information regarding Baruch College’s policy on Academic Integrity is available at: http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/academic/academic_honesty.html

Course Policy if Academic Dishonesty Occurs
Academic dishonesty will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. If found guilty, consequences will range from no credit for the assignment in question to a failing grade for the entire course plus the penalties imposed by the college.

Tutoring 
MSPIA may provide “one-on-one” and “walk-in” tutoring services for PAF 9272 students. This is particularly recommended if you are struggling to understand the concepts and do the assignments even after attending the lecture and working through the in-class examples and quizzes. You will receive information regarding tutoring in a separate email from MSPIA. (If you have specific questions about the homework or the lecture it is usually more efficient to contact me directly by email or via slack than going through tutoring, so don’t hesitate to get in touch with me throughout the semester!)

MSPIA Advisement
A full range of academic advisement services are provided to Marxe students to ensure the successful completion of their degree programs. Visit their website at: https://marxe.baruch.cuny.edu/academics/marxe-advisement/ or email them at: mspia.advisement@baruch.cuny.edu.
